# KeyPadLock

In this project the team members shall implement a Keypad-Controlled Lock system, originally developed by John Boxall. The project describes a system that allows the user to enter a six-digit code into the system and the system returns true if the code entered by user matches the secret sixdigit code stored at the back-end of the system.[1]
